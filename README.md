ABOUT
This program takes the paths provided and opens them. I made this to for myself so I don't have to
keep opening folders or programs everytime I want to work on a project, I can just run one command and everything is
opened for me.

HOW IT WORKS
automation.py
This script takes the paths and stores them in a preset. Here you can select the preset (project) you are working on as 
the default preset. The default preset will then open if you double click run.py or run run.py any other way.

run.py
Takes the paths from the preset and opens the folders and programs.
